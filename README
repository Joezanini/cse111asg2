This project recreates the terminal shell. It is almost an exact copy of the shell. 

I am working alone, not doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted here is code written by me, except for code copied from the instructorâ€™s directories.
I have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates. https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html
